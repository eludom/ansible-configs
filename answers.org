  - Answer : https://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_intro.html

    #+begin_example
    Tasks list

    Each play contains a list of tasks. Tasks are executed in order, one
    at a time, against all machines matched by the host pattern, before
    moving on to the next task. It is important to understand that, within
    a play, all hosts are going to get the same task directives. It is the
    purpose of a play to map a selection of hosts to tasks.
